      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          I recently came across <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00605">this paper</a> about base64, a data encoding algorithm I had little to no idea about. Reading it 
          changed the way I look at how data is represented and sent across the globe. In this piece I want to go over what 
          I understand from the paper about this algorithm and write the code for a simple base64 encoder and decoder in python and C, 
          one step at a time.

      <h2>Why should I care?</h2>
      <article>
      <p>According to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">wikipedia</a>: </p>
      
        <p><i>  <b>Base64</b> (also known as tetrasexagesimal) is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that transforms binary data into 
        a sequence of printable characters, limited to a set of 64 unique characters. More specifically, the source binary data 
        is taken 6 bits at a time, then this group of 6 bits is mapped to one of 64 unique characters.
        </i></p>

      </article>

      <article>
      <p>
        In simpler words, base64 encoding is a scheme or a sequence of steps that allows us to convert binary data, a representation 
        that computers operate in to be more transportable and understandable. The scheme purposefully limits itself to a set of 64 printable
        (or) displayable characters that are universally accepted. 
      </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <p>
          That sounds alright, but now the question is: Why should I care? I mean, it's nice that we get to do all of this, but what's the impact?
          Well, for this we need a bit of a history lesson: in a computer, text is mainly represented by byte strings. If you know basic Python, 
          then the following code:
        </p>

        <pre><code>print([ord(s) for s in "Man"])</code></pre>
      </article>

      <article>
        <p>would yield us this output:  <pre><code>[77, 97, 110]</code></pre> 
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
          This is called ASCII or American Standard Code for Information Interchange  (ah yes, america) a standard that has been around for a long time that allows computers to be process and store text effectively. But there's only one problem: 
          This standard only works for english, and no other language, nor special characters (like that one side eye emoji, or emojis in general). So now the clever people made a new standard called UTF-8 (or unicode), a character set that includes 
          ASCII as its subset but also allows other languages and special characters to be encoded.
      </article>

      <article>
        <p>
          The <code>ord()</code> function in python allows for us to check the ASCII value. To get the unicode equivalent, we can use the <code>str.encode()</code>
          method to get the byte strings in unicode. So the code in python for this will be: 
        </p>

        <pre><code>
u = chr(40960) + 'abcd' + chr(1972)
res = u.encode('utf-8')
inp = res.decode('utf-8')
        </code></pre>

      </article>

      <article>
        <p>
          So thats how we represent different string formats and languages in the unicode format. But now there's a different problem. 
          And it has to do with how computer memory works.
        </p>

      <h2>Bits and Bytes</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          Every piece of information in a computer is ultimately stored as a <b>bit</b> — either <code>1</code> or <code>0</code>. When 8 bits come together, we get a <b>byte</b>.
          And different data types (aka how we represent integer numbers, decimal numbers upto arbitrary precision and string characters) varies a lot. So for simplicity I am going
          to consider the C as our language and our CPU to be 64bit. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Given these conditions, here's how much memory these three take:
          <ol>
            <li><b>Integer</b>: Typically <code>4 bytes</code> (32 bits) in most systems like C. In Python, size varies.</li>
            <li><b>Floating point</b>: 
              <ul>
                <li><code>4 bytes</code> for <i>float</i> (single precision)</li>
                <li><code>8 bytes</code> for <i>double</i> (double precision)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>String</b>: Size varies based on content and encoding. For example, ASCII takes <code>1 byte</code> per character, UTF-8 can take <code>1–4 bytes</code> per character.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          The reason why string varies is because of two factors: size and encoding (ASCII/UTF-8/UTF-16). Depending on the encoding, each character/letter of a string can take from 1 byte to 4 bytes. 
          That's all well and good, and honestly unicode has revolutionized the entire computing industry and allowed for a lot more freedom to developers. But there's a small problem now: How do we do
          any kind of data transfer?

      <h2>THE algorithm of the internet</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          Base64 is the answer to the above question (as far as my pine sized knowledge base goes) and we will be implementing the most basic version of it in python by making some assumptions. 
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <p>
          But before we dive in we have to understand how this algorithm even works. If you don't really have all the background, but it's alright; I believe the information presented in the previous sections should be enough for you to follow along, 
          but feel free to search the web and correct me if you find any mistakes :)
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <p>
            Let's define some variables to keep notations simple. Say we have a string S that we'd like to encode using the base64 algorithm into encoded string E. We can assume the number of bytes it takes as B
            and number of bits it takes as N. And one final assumption is a mapping function F that maps string letters to anywhere in range (0, 64]. 
            <ol>
              <li>We have to check whether the byte representation B's length is divisible by 3 or not. Depending on this we have to pad (or add extra characters) to the string</li>
              <li>The bit stream is divided into 3 chunks of 8 bits each and combined. </li>
              <li>These chunks are later converted to 4 chunks of 6 bits each</li>
              <li>These new chunks are converted into their integer representations</li>
              <li>Using their mapping function, these 6 bit integers are converted into Base64 characters and joined to form out encoded string E</li>
              <li>So for our earlier example at the start, Man (S) -> Encoding -> TWFu (E). </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          Okay... well, that's it. But no seriously there's a lot to uncover here:
        </p>

        <article>
          Firstly, about the chunk conversion from 3 chunks of 8 bits to 4 chunks of 6 bits. Remember in the earlier section how one byte is 8 bits? and how each bit is either 
          0 or 1? There's a small hidden secret there! You see, when we want to calculate any integer, we simply just flip the bits to get the next or previous number. Here are 
          some examples: 
            <ol>
              <li> 2  (base: int)  ->  10     (base: binary)</li>
              <li> 10 (base: int)  ->  1010   (base: binary)</li>
              <li> 63 (base: int)  ->  111111 (base: binary)</li>
            </ol>
          
          Side note: a base is just a way to record which notation are we in, and yes there are others. And a simple trick to get the binary representation is to simply divide by 
          2 and keep track of the reminders from bottom to top (a simplified explanation). 
        </article>

        <p>
          Essentially, we are converting a character with that is represented using 8 bits with a higher range (8 bits -> 2 ^ 8 = 256) to 6 bits with a 
          lower range (6 bits -> 2 ^ 6 = 64). Why specifically this? Because this range allows for us to print the strings in safe ASCII representations (the base64 ASCII isnt quite 
          the full ASCII range). But I do want to cover more about this point in a future blog/article!
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <p>Surprisingly, this wasn't hard at all to implement in python. Here's the code: </p>
        <pre><code>

  base64_table = {
      i: c for i, c in enumerate(
          'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/'
      )
  }

  def encode_b64(string: str) -> str:
      encoded_array = []
      final_string = []
      byte_array = [ord(x) for x in string]
      bit_stream = ''.join(format(ord(x), '08b') for x in string)

      if len(byte_array) % 3 == 0:
          print(f"While encoding, the bit stream will be divided into: {len(byte_array) / 3}")
          for idx in range(0, len(bit_stream), 6):
              encoded_array.append(
                  bit_stream[idx: idx + 6]
              )

          for idx, chunk in enumerate(encoded_array):
              bit_stream_chunk = ''.join(chunk)
              ascii_b64_char = base64_table[
                  int(bit_stream_chunk, 2)
              ]
              final_string.append(ascii_b64_char)

          return ''.join(final_string)
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          But there are some catches: We are assuming that the length of our string is divisible by 3. I didnt include the padding logic yet because I still haven't completely 
          gone through the spec sheet yet. Notice how the code will break when <code>len(byte_array) % 3 == 0?</code> In other words,  if the check for whether the string's 
          length is divisible by 3 fails, the code returns None. This isn't how the full algorithm works, it adds padding beforehand to ensure the condition is met. 
        </p>

      </article>

      <article>
        <p>
          The encoding is the hard part. When we run the same steps backwards with a few changes, we can decode our algorithm. Often times decoding is as simple as tracing our 
          steps back and making tweaks along the way. When we have an encoded string E, a bit stream E_s of length N_e, our previous mapping function F and a reverse base of that 
          say F_d; the decoding algorithm will look something like this: 

          <ol>
            <li>Enure that N_e is divisible by 4. If not we have to remove all the padding characters to ensure the condition is met.</li>
            <li>Once the first step is done, we can safely trace back our previous steps. We first divide the bit stream we obtain by using the mapping function F_d. </li>
            <li>For every 3 chunks of 8 bits each, we can convert it back to the proper 8-bit integer representation.</li>
            <li>The initial string S is thus obtained. As per our examples TWFu (E) -> Decoding -> Man (S)</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>Code wise, here's how it looks: </p>
        <pre><code>
reverse_base64_table = {
    v: k for k,v in base64_table.items() # referred to in earlier code.
}

def decode_b46_text(string: str):
    encoded_array = []
    decoded_string = []
    bit_stream = ''.join(format(reverse_base64_table[x], '06b') for x in string)

    if len(string) % 4 == 0:
        print(f"While decoding, the bit stream will be divided into: {len(string) / 4}")
        for idx in range(0, len(bit_stream), 8):
            encoded_array.append(
                    bit_stream[idx: idx + 8]
            )

        for idx, chunk in enumerate(encoded_array):

            bit_stream_chunk = ''.join(chunk)
            
            decimal_num = int(bit_stream_chunk, 2)
            decoded_string.append(chr(decimal_num))

        return ''.join(decoded_string)

        </code></pre>
      </article>

      <h2>Verdict?</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          Base64 is a simple but effective algorithm, and in my opinion every developer should read the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648"> 
          base64 spec</a> and try to implement it once in their career and understand its importance for data transportation. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Initially I wanted to make this into a much larger article but I've noticed that even I won't read it. So I've decided to divide it into a series of articles
          to deep dive more into this algorithm. In the next algorithm I will talk more in alignment with the base64 specification and perhaps demonstrate using a C 
          implementation. 
        </p>
